# Personal Website

Welcome to the code for my website. It can be viewed live [here](https://jamesquillin.com). It is mostly a place for various articles about programming as well as a place to keep my own notes and recipes. My main design goal was to make something that was easy to read on my phone while cooking, so I'm happy that I think I achieved that.

## Running the Application

If you want to try cloning and modifying it feel free. It is built with Jekyll so you will need to have Ruby installed, and once you clone the code you can install the dependencies with bundler. To run the app you can use the command:

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

and it should start running locally. If you wanted to deploy a similar site, you can also check out [this post](https://jamesquillin.com/articles/simple-website-deployment/) which I wrote and which is on that site -- it details my favorite deployment strategy for simple apps and works great for all sorts of personal projects like this.

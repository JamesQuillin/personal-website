## Notes

Since I never have tomato sauce around I just mix in a couple tablespoons of tomato paste into some more broth/stock, so that I end up with two cups of liquid per cup of rice that I use.

Don't skip the step about stirring it, putting the lid back on, and letting it steam off of the heat for 10 minutes at the end. It 100% makes the difference between dorm-room rice and restaurant rice.

Feel free to add other things, especially peppers. This is just the most basic version I could find and I love it for how easy it is to make since I don't need to go to the store for anything special that I don't already usually have around.

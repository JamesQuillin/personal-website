title: Tortillas
description: Really simple tortillas. Best made in a larger batch or probably not worth it (at least for two people) since they are best when warm.

## Notes

Makes 6 small, 4 medium, or 2 large tortillas.

Keep them in a pile inside a towel or some paper towels so they all keep each other warm while you cook them all.

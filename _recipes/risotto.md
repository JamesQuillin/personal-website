## Notes

Don't skip the part about cooking the onions unless you like crunchy onions.

Stir slowly at first because the pan will be really full until the mushrooms reduce in size. You want to keep stirring throughout the whole cooking time because that's how you make sure the rice gets evenly cooked. You don't really have to stir 100% of the time, but it's not a recipe where you can leave it for 15 minutes and just stir it once or twice.

Be careful when seasoning as you go because it's really easy to overseason it and have it be super salty or peppery when it has finished and cooled a little.

Here's a look at kind of consistency what we are going for: [(7 minutes, 8 seconds in)](https://youtu.be/-oxjhgVp4y4?t=428). You don't want it to be runny but you also don't want it to hold its shape. 

I like mushroom risotto because it's the easiest one to make. If you google "risotto" and start clicking through recipes then your shopping list can get really long really quickly. If you do make a fancier risotto with something like lobster make sure you add your delicate ingredients at the end so they don't end up as mush.

## Notes

You can put pretty much any kind of protein, beans, or vegetables in a chili. I really like adding corn. This is also a great recipe to "hide" vegetables. I have added kale before and it turned out really well.

Use less liquid or let it simmer with the lid off if you want a thicker, drier chili, and conversely use more liquid or simmer with the lid on if you want that.

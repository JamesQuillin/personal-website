description: The rice is the hardest part, but a good rice cooker makes it much easier (I always use one). I sometimes just do plain rice. The beans are really easy.

## Notes

Makes a great base for all sorts of other ingredients for burritos or bowls similar to what you might get at Chipotle. I like adding easy ingredients like peppers (can just chop and cook them while the beans simmer) or sour cream.

## Notes

Each piece should be about half an inch thick and 3-4 inches long and wide.

You can add all sorts of spices to the batter to flavor the final product a bit. Paprika is popular but I don't really like it in this dish so I just use salt.

I like using a small pot for this so that I can get to the ¼ inch deep mark with less oil, and the higher sides help to contain any splatter. 

Tongs also make it easier if you are bad at flipping them like I am.

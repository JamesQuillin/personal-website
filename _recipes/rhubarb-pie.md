title: Rhubarb Pie
description: This is a good way to use a bunch of rhubarb if you have it, but it's a decent amount of work. Extra pies freeze really well too, and overall it is really really tasty.

## Notes

You can assemble a bunch of pies and freeze them before cooking if you have a lot of rhubarb to use. Then just cook them a little longer than normal without defrosting them, when you do cook them.

I got the pie recipe from [here](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/12316/fresh-rhubarb-pie/).

I got the crust recipe from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xuZ9voHjuI). I have used it for all sorts of things before and it's super easy. That channel is pretty fun in general, with lots of recipes that turn out to be really simple, which is one of my favorite things in a recipe.

Making the pie crust once is fun but multiple times is a lot of work and takes a lot of space and cleanup, so don't feel like you have to make a crust for it to turn out well.

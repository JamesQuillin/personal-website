# Creamy Soups and Chowders

- any other ingredients you want
- 2-3 cups of milk

- melt the butter and stir in the flour
- add everything else with enough liquid to cover
- simmer on a low heat until it's done
- add anything delicate at the end

## My Favorite Combinations

- kale, potato, onion, garlic, sausage, stock, cream
- potatoes, leeks, bacon, and lots of black pepper
- corn, celery, onions, potatoes, and thyme
- onions, celery, garlic, potatoes, and clams

## Notes

It's the same as making a regular soup but you mix flour into the butter before adding anything else, and you use some kind of creamy liquid (milk, cream, almondmilk, or a mixture of some kind of creamy liquid with stock) instead of just broth or stock.

They are a great way to use up root vegetables, canned vegetables, and any vegetables you don't really like (like Kale for me). They are really hearty, cheap, and filling.

## Notes

This dough recipe is for two pizzas about 10 to 12 inches in diameter, and when cooked comes out as a fairly thin crust.

I wouldn't recommend doing this recipe for a thicker crust because it isn't a yeast-based recipe and so the crust itself isn't all that much to get excited about (a real dough where you give it a lot of time to rise has much more flavor, but also takes a lot more time and space).

To make the sauce just blend or mash the tomatoes and simmer them with the oil and a pinch of salt while stirring. The sauce goes well on pasta too if the tomatoes are fresh and ripe.

For a thicker sauce you can add some tomato paste.

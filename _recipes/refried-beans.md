# Refried Beans

- 1 can of pinto beans (I rinse mine)
- 2 tbsp of butter or oil
- ¼ tsp garlic powder
- ¼ tsp onion powder
- ¼ tsp salt

- put everything in a small pot
- cook on medium until the beans are soft (5-10 minutes)
- mash or add water 1 tbsp at at time to get the consistency you want

## Notes

You can add in peppers or cheese or really anything that sounds good to you.

You can also hunt down some of the more traditional techniques and ingredients and actually fry the beans in a pan and all that. I just like this way because it takes less than a minute to put together and you can just leave it while you work on other parts of the meal.

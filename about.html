<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is James and I'm a software engineer who loves building applications for the web. I think the web is an incredible platform, with the possibility to reach such a wide array of people, and I love how with just a couple of core technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) you can build almost anything and distribute it to almost anyone worldwide.</p>

<p>My favorite tool is definitely React, but I'm comfortable with picking up any front-end or back-end library or framework, since chances are that I have used something similar before, and I'm confident in my ability to quickly pick up anything new.</p>

<p>If you would like to see a little more about the tools I have used and the applications I have built recetly then you can check out <a href="https://jamesquillin.github.io" target="_blank">my portfolio</a>. You can also find more detailed descriptions of my most recent projects <a href="/projects">here</a>.</p>
